        There once was a guy named John Aldinger. He was 20 years young. He lived with his blue tiger, Fred, in one of the jungles of Africa. 
        John was a descendent of a man known as “The Father of colorful language”, Smitty McWhosywhatzy, (This doesn’t mean Smitty used improper language; 
        it just means he talked pretty funny.) In his lifetime, Smitty was better known as “The crazy old man which doth terrify the orcs and telleth them 
        to get out of his crash-mudded yard and to take their newfangled confabulations with them” (See? There’s the funny language.).

    <p>
        One night, three dark, shady figures crept up unwelcome to John’s hut. They set fire to it for no reason.
    </p>
    <p>When John woke up, he got out of bed and realized his house was burned down.</p>
    <p>John was mad. “I’m mad!” he yelled.</p>
    <p>
        John saw monkey tracks scattered about. “Aha!” he shouted, “The monkeys!” John disliked monkeys as much as Smitty disliked orcs. 
        In other words, he thought they were ram-crusted pests (more funny language).
    </p>
    <p>
        John gave a local 20 monkey teeth (the currency in that village) and asked if he noticed any strange goings-on last night.
        The local said he saw three monkeys with torches, ski masks, and fireproof gloves, but he hadn’t noticed anything out of the ordinary.
    </p>
    <p>John’s suspicions were confirmed. He got angered and yelled angrily and with much anger, “I’m ANGRY!” He began plotting his revenge…</p>

    <h3>2</h3>
    <p>
        John traded his banana tree to a scuba diver for the diver’s black suit. 
        John then searched through the remains of his house for anything that might not be burnt. 
        He found his rally towel that he waved every time he watched the Eagles play, dyed it blue, and made it into a shoulder cape. 
        He bought blue and white gloves and a blue pauldron. He found his blue belt with a white buckle in the ashes of his hut.
    </p>
    <p>
        One day, John was walking around thinking about how to deal with the monkeys, when he found something very interesting. 
        A split coconut! And it fit his head perfectly! John sanded off the rough edges with sandpaper, coated the coconut with steel, and painted it black.
        He next melted the remaining glass in his hut into a visor and tinted it blue. 
        Then John bought some small computers, disassembled them, and made them into an X-ray vision monkey finder visor upgrade machine and a monkey RADAR 
        scanner; he put these two helmet enhancers on the sides of his helmet.
    </p>
    <p>
        John knew he would need a weapon with which to fight the monkeys. He mastered fighting with a stick, but when he tried it on a gorilla, he got 
        slapped 2.179 times. (The one didn’t count as a whole slap because the gorilla barely grazed John’s pinky.)
        John knew a stick wouldn’t do, so he bought a 4½-foot steel pole, two tasers, and a super-solar panel (to recharge his tasers).
    </p>
    <p>“I need a name.” he told Fred one day. Fred nodded.</p>
    <p>
        “I know! I have no house, so I’m a hobo, even though that don’t mean a thing. So, I’ll be Captain Heauxbeaux! 
        And I’ll spell it H-E-A-U-X-B-E-A-U-X, because that looks cooler.
    </p>
    <p>So John put a “CH” on his suit and his helmet, and set out with Fred to get the monkeys…</p>
